**Half-Life 2: Sandbox**  
https://github.com/Planimeter/hl2sb-src

Some code for Srcbox (lua, physgun implantetion) have been ported and updated for the modern SDK, from the most recent branch, and the original 2007 code.
The lua dll that is compatible with this mod can be found here (x64) https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.1.5/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/ (lua-5.1.5_Win64_dll17_lib.zip)

**LUX Shaders**  
By Shiro (WhiteRedDragons)
https://github.com/LUX-Shaders-Team

Rewritten Shaders with features up-to L4D2/Portal 2/CSGO/.

It is important for sandbox enviroment, as later game maps use newer params not found in the SDK 2013.

**Notice! LUX Shaders IS NOT included at the current moment! It will be included with this project once its open-sourced**

Alot of L4D stuff from Alien Swarm was ported over by these guys, and has been used as a reference for how to plug it into this mod.
